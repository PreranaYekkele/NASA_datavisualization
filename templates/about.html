                    beginning in 1972. The Space Shuttle system—composed of an orbiter launched with two reusable solid
                    rocket boosters and a disposable external fuel tank— carried up to eight astronauts and up to 50,000 lb
                    (23,000 kg) of payload into low Earth orbit (LEO). When its mission was complete, the orbiter would re-enter
                    the Earth's atmosphere and land like a glider at either the Kennedy Space Center or Edwards Air Force Base.

                    from 1986 to 2001, operated by the Soviet Union and later by Russia. Mir was the first modular space
                    station and was assembled in orbit from 1986 to 1996. It had a greater mass than any previous spacecraft.
                    At the time it was the largest artificial satellite in orbit, succeeded by the International Space Station after Mir's orbit decayed.
                    The station served as a microgravity research laboratory in which crews conducted experiments in biology, human biology, physics,
                    astronomy, meteorology and spacecraft systems with a goal of developing technologies required for permanent occupation of space.

                    research space stations and two crewed military reconnaissance space stations over a period of 15 years,
                    from 1971 to 1986. Two other Salyut launches failed. In one respect, Salyut had the task of carrying
                    out long-term research into the problems of living in space and a variety of astronomical, biological
                    and Earth-resources experiments, and on the other hand the USSR used this civilian program as a cover
                    for the highly secretive military Almaz stations, which flew under the Salyut designation. Salyut 1,
                    the first station in the program, became the world's first crewed space station.

                    Skylab was the United States' first space station, orbiting Earth from 1973 to 1979, when it fell back
                    to Earth amid huge worldwide media attention. Launched and operated by NASA, Skylab included a workshop,
                    a solar observatory, and other systems necessary for crew survival and scientific experiments. It was
                    launched unmanned by a modified Saturn V rocket, with a weight of 170,000 pounds (77,111 kg). Lifting
                    Skylab into low earth orbit was the final mission and launch of a Saturn V rocket (which was famous for
                    carrying the manned Moon landing missions).[2] Skylab was not simply a place of habitation; massive
                    science experimentation was undertaken there. When data from these experiments (some of which were on
                    physical film) were returned to Earth, analysis of scientific and engineering data of each mission was
                    completed. Skylab's solar observatory was one of its major functions. Solar science was significantly
                    advanced by the telescope, and its observation of the Sun was unprecedented. As the Skylab program drew
                    to a close, NASA's focus had shifted to the development of the Space Shuttle, through which NASA hoped
                    to reduce the cost of space access compared to previous launch systems.
